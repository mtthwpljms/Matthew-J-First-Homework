# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Author: Matthew James

Description:

While refactoring this website, I was able to remove many of the nonsemantic elements such as <div> elements and replaced them with semantic elements. For example, I have replaced the <div> tags in the header with <nav> tags, as the header is used to navigate the main content of the website. I also segmented the main content and subcontent with <section> tags rather than <div>. Additionally, I have restructured the headings to fit a more logical structure by changing the footer from <h2> to <h4>. I have altered the CSS syntax to match the changes in the HTML file. On top of these changes, I was able to fix the Search Image Optimization link in order for the the link to navigate users to the Search Image Optimization section.
I have changed the title of the webpage from "website" to "Optimize Your Marketing" in order to give users an idea of what the webpage can offer them.
I have added descriptions to each supplementary on the webpage in order for a description to show if the image does not load correctly or if a visually impaired user is using a screen reader.
I have also reordered the CSS structure to follow a path from the top of the webpage down, while ordering each section by text formatting, images, and the visual containers of the content.
I have done all of the above while keeping to the original aesthetic of the website.
